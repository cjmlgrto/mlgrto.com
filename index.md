Embracing the fluid & flexible aspect of responsive web design was an easy decision, but I’ve been less sure-footed when it comes to balancing that with setting type on the web.

From a purely typographic perspective, one could argue that an adaptive approach (where we set breakpoints around fixed-width containers of text to precisely govern measure) is ideal. If a site is only text that may be true, but when images, video, or more complex multi-column layouts come into play, I find my core beliefs in the benefits of building on a [flexible foundation](http://blog.stephencaver.com/post/3467737777/building-towards-responsiveness) reaffirmed. For me, “ideal” on the web isn’t about pixel-perfection anymore, but about seeking the most pragmatic approach to balancing different kinds of content with an ever-increasing number of screen sizes and resolutions.
