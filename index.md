# Slides That Sell

There are a lot of resources on the web for [PowerPoint themes]() and the like. Although they’re there to make a stale slide-deck look more appealing, simply having nice fonts and colors won’t make a presentation more engaging.

Although I’m no expert at presentations, I consider myself a slideshow connoisseur. Ever since high school, I’ve always [enjoyed designing](), presenting, and even watching slideshows. (If you know me well enough, you know that I’m always up at 3am for Apple Keynotes). I enjoy them because I think slideshows are the perfect medium for more formal, visual storytelling.

Now that I’m an entrepreneur, slideshows (or pitch decks in the startup world) have become more of a utility than an art for me. In order for a business to succeed, the quality of its slides must be able to engage both potential investors and fans alike. And to reach pitch perfect, slideshows require not only to be eye-catching-ly gorgeous, but must also be effective at communicating ideas.

## One Idea Per Slide

### This is a subheading

The best way to illustrate this is through action: grab a thick marker and a handful of sticky notes. Before opening up your [computer](), draw out your entire slideshow on those sticky notes.

## Less Words, More Graphics

Don’t let the slides to the talking. It is your job to talk, and for the slides to help you with your talk. So that means no paragraphs or bullet points. Maybe a sentence, at most. If you can do it in a few words, that’s good. But the quickest, most straightforward way of presenting an idea is through a picture.
