The style guide dictates the overall visual style and writing style of the entire website. Visually— in order for the text to look *aesthetically appealing* and highly readable even for the most [unlettered](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/unlettered) of readers— the text is broken down into chunks, each with their own respective subheading.

In terms of writing however, there are three rules:

1. Use as little jargon as possible,
2. Write frankly,
3. And a conversational tone makes reading more enjoyable (doesn't it?).

### Sub-sub headings look like this

Distinct sections such as this one are only to be used when a different idea needs to be conveyed. Not only does this make a lengthy article look skimmable, it also allows the reader to experience the full visual style of the website. Also notice the extra breathing room between each section above the subheading.
