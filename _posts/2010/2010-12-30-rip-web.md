title: Is the Web dead?
subtitle: Introducing the Google Chromebook.

It’s been a while since I last used _Photoshop_. All my time spent using the computer were mainly focused on the web. Websites, webpages, webapps. It’s all got something to do with the very fabric of the internet called ‘the web’. A few months ago, Wired.com had this post titled; “[The Web is Dead](https://www.wired.com/2010/08/ff_webrip/all/1)”. It referred to consumers using more of these ‘apps’ and less time on the browser. Less time on the browser. Exactly the opposite of what I do, and probably, what others do.

It’s probably Google’s launch of their new “Chrome Web App Store” or their release of the new “[Cr-48](https://www.google.com/chromebook/)” netbooks where “everything is stored on the cloud”. Or maybe it’s just me. 

When Apple launched the iPhone, and the App Store, we focused less time on the browser, and more on these ‘apps’. When you want to check your e-mail, you use an app. When you want to check the weather, you use an app. When you want to read recipes for quick meals, all you have to do is tap an app. It’s all on the apps.

But what about the browser. What’s there to do on the browser? Maybe look at some news? No, there’s an [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) reader for that. How about some games? No, Flash is too fussy. How about reading some websites? Most of them are now incorporating RSS.

It’s these programs, applications, executables, or whatever-you-call-its is what makes the web feel extinct. And Google’s vision is to stop that. Which is exactly what I’ve been doing for the past couple of weeks.

It’s all about to change for us web users again when the launch of the Mac App Store arrives. Will it persuade me to migrate from browser to desktop? Maybe yes, but I don’t know for sure.
