There’s a new kid on the block. He’s carrying with him a box of shiny new toys. You might trust this kid, because you already know his parents. He always wears that 4-colored t-shirt, and that weird badge that says “I’m feeling lucky”.

That new kid, the one with the shiny new toys and the 4-colored t-shirt[^1], is Google’s latest invention. His name?

_Google+._

Just a few days ago, Google launched an apparently new way to socialize on the web[^2]. It’s just like those other over-hyped social networking sites, but with a bit of Google-Awesomeness™ mixed in. Google+ (Google Plus as it’s pronounced) will include the ability to share “what you’re doing now” plus five other new social ‘experiences’. Now, the question that comes in mind is this: “What’s the difference between Facebook (or other social websites) and Google+?”

Google basically controls _every_ known website in the internet, and just like Facebook, it is being used by millions of people, around the world. That means, anyone who knows Google, _will_ know Google+, and _if_ Google does it right, sign-ups will be instantaneous and easy. You also might say, “Google doesn’t have those cool apps and games like Facebook does!” But as I have mentioned earlier, they control every known website in the interwebs, and as easy as giving you the link, you can link these 3rd-party webapps right into Google+.

Numbers don’t only make a point on why Google just made Facebook “The New Myspace”, because Google+ comes with some awesome features you don’t normally see (I think) on other social networking websites. In Google+, they’ve created a feature called “Circles”, where you group some of your friends into smaller, topic-driven friendship circles. There’s another feature in Google+ called “Hangouts”, and I don’t really understand the concept, but I think it’s when one of your buddies is online, browsing Google+, you can quickly start a video chat session with that person and the same goes for everyone else that’s online and browsing Google+, much like Skype’s conference call feature, but it’s in-browser. There were also minor features included in Google+, and those were instant photo uploads and a group messaging service called 'Huddle’.

It may sure sound like an awesome idea, whatever Google+ is truly meant to be, but not all of it is fun and rainbows. Google+ is invite-only, so that means, you just have to wait until you brag about being a part of this Google thing.
