[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)’s a publishing platform (sort of like Tumblr) I’ve been playing around with the past few days that’s apparently simple, and feels lightweight. As a matter of fact, it does feel lightweight, writing themes for it couldn’t be easy enough, and publishing articles with Jekyll is ridiculously fun. However, it’s not as simple as it is to get it set up:

1. Download and install [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12&ign-mpt=uo%3D4)
2. Within Xcode, download & install the command line utilities.
3. Open up Terminal, and [download & install RVM](http://www.seanbehan.com/installing-and-using-rvm-on-mac-os-x-creating-gemsets-and-reverting-to-original-environment).
4. Then install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh).
5. In Terminal, enter `brew install jekyll`.
6. While that’s happening, create a folder with an `index.html` and another file called: `_config.yml`.
7. If it’s finished installing, make Terminal cd into that folder.
8. You’re almost done: create a theme from scratch, or pick a [pre-built](http://themes.jekyllbootstrap.com) (half-done) theme.
9. Enter `jekyll --server --auto` to ‘run’ your server and go to `http://localhost:4000` to preview it.
10. Configure Jekyll so that you can upload it to a web server.
11. Finally, you’re done.

I tried to simplify it as much as I could. It’s a pain to get it all set up (especially when I’m not particularly interested to dabble within Terminal) however once it’s up it becomes thrilling to write and publish posts.

Quick review of Jekyll: It’s all too fiddly for me, however writing and publishing feels much easier. Jekyll’s great for the knowledgable web developer, but not for me; I’m sticking to the one and only, [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com).
