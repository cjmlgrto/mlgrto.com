It was the morning after the [WWDC Keynote](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/). Apple just dropped the first developer preview of the shiny-new [iOS 10](http://www.apple.com/ios/ios10-preview/). Nearly everyone on my Twitter feed had installed the beta build already. It looked gorgeous— and it looked different. And that gave me the idea to design a pixel-for-pixel recreation of the shiny-new interface [in Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com)— a _UI Kit_— then share it with the world.

I had exams next week— so I procrasti-worked. I put my headphones on, turned up the [20syl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65oZD-7gJYE), and crunched it. Fast forward a couple of hours, plus help from [Ramon Gilabert](https://github.com/ramongilabert), and [we finished it](http://puzzles.design). 20+ screens, interface elements, and all that’s new in iOS 10. [Ready to download](http://puzzles.design), and ready to re-use so the design community can start designing for iOS 10.

We released it on the Thursday before the end of WWDC. And it spread like wildfire. It was free and _open-source_, after all. A day and half later, the UI kit was linked on a popular [German tech site](http://t3n.de/news/ios-10-ui-kit-717325/), used by designers [at Uber](https://www.producthunt.com/tech/ios-10-ui-kit#comment-311057) and [Facebook](https://twitter.com/gabrielvaldivia/status/747596711430762497), and then put up on the [Designer News Market](https://www.designernews.co/market/265-ios-10-ui-kit). Needless to say, but it’s been one heck of a week.

So, [go and have a look](http://puzzles.design)! Check out the [Git Repo](https://github.com/iOS10-KIT/UI), and download it.
