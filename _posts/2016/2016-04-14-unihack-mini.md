Last weekend, I took the pleasure of volunteering as a mentor for [UNIHACK Mini](http://unihack.net/mini)— a hackathon for first-time hackathoners. Just like the UNIHACK I competed in last year, it was an event filled to the brim with startup culture, programming, and solid advice from industry leaders.

I learnt _so much_ while mentoring as much others learnt from me. So I decided to note down my disorganised thoughts and publish them for you to learn from as well. (And yes, that’s a photo of me taken by the great [Tom Solari](https://www.facebook.com/tomsolariphotography/), as I write this very post).

## On Tech Hackathons

First things first: tech hackathons are unlike anything else. When you walk into a room of programmers and developers, you immediately get a glimpse of the future. Majority of the time spent in tech hackathons are dedicated to building the best prototype you can make— and allocating any less defeats the purpose of the event.

I’ve seen a lot of teams spend hours planning out their ideas— some even took an entire day. To really maximise a hackathon, you have to bring ideas with you at the start, and get your team to high-gear in development as soon as you walk in. Also: bring a laptop if you can. Don’t waste time installing and copying over your development environment to a new computer.

## On Ideas

Execution is everything. At the beginning of the event, every team pitched an idea that sounded well-rounded and promising. But towards the end, I noticed in some teams that while their prototypes did include their grand idea, it wasn’t as polished nor presented as they had hoped.

I think this lesson can be generalised to startups and new companies turning ideas into products. The value of an idea doesn’t come from the idea itself, but its potential. In other words, the output is more valuable than the input. Problems aren’t fully solved unless the solution is at least elegant.

## On Learning

Everyone’s a first-timer at some point. The great thing about UNIHACK Mini is that a lot of the people who signed up for it were either amateur programmers or first-time software developers. This is awesome because it shows there are a lot of students who believe they have the potential to make something great. But on the day, there were some who put that pressure on themselves way too much.

Just because you can’t do X right now doesn’t mean you can never do it. I suppose, if you’re surrounded by people who are better than you, you can feel alienated by your lack of talent/knowledge/skill. But here’s the thing: in a room full of people more adept than you, you basically have all the resources to make yourself as good as— if not, better than— them. Your brain is a sponge— _use it like a sponge_. Don’t feel discouraged by your lack of skill. Instead, use those feelings to motivate yourself and learn.

Hackathons are the best places to experiment with what you know and what you don’t know. Even as a non-competitor, I got a chance to play around with my skills in mentoring and teaching. But as it turns out, everyone’s a learner, and I walked out of UNIHACK Mini with more wisdom than I started with.
