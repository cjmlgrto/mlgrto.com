I spent the entirety of the past weekend at a [hackathon](https://www.monash.edu/science/about/events/global-hunger-hack) for [my course](http://haveyougottheedge.com)— and I can only say that it’s been insanely _exhilarating_.

Here’s what we did: we were given _3 days_ to come up with a solution to _global hunger_— be it _food insecurity_, _malnutrition_, or even just preventing _food waste_. In teams, we were then tasked to turn our solution into a [minimum-viable startup](http://giphy.com/gifs/veep-reid-scott-dan-eagan-12EidnsFgFGtoY), create business plans, and at the end, pitch to a panel of [judges](http://www.stcaustralia.org/about-us/team/).

Our team focused on malnutrition; that is, giving the _right nutrients_ to the disadvantaged. It felt like a daunting task to begin with, but we were up for the challenge. We spent the next 48 hours with [amazing](https://twitter.com/marinaparonetto) [people](https://twitter.com/gilbertjoshuam), collaborating on a [brand](http://instagram.com/growyourown.cc), [products](http://growyourown.cc), and a strategy— one I’ll perhaps blog about in the near future. We worked through the night— and finally, at the end of it all, our team’s founder, [Elle Phillips](http://twitter.com/ellephee1), presented the pitch.

And we _won_.

To be specific, [we](http://growyourown.cc) were part of [three](http://the-cricket-effect.launchrock.com) [teams](http://fedupfood.org) that were awarded. Each of those three get the chance to run their startup through an [accelerator program](http://99tolaunch.com). It’s humbling to win such a fantastic opportunity. (Plus, we’ve hit [the news](http://www.startupsmart.com.au/news-analysis/local/monash-university-runs-its-first-hackathon-to-fight-global-hunger/), _baby_).

All in all, it’s been a great experience— one I’ll _never_ forget. Little did I know what I was going into the week before, and now, I’m officially part of a startup. (Which you can [check out here](http://growyourown.cc)!) It’s because of this, I’m more excited for what [my course](http://twitter.com/erinlynnaus) has got in store for this year.
