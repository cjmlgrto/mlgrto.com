subtitle: I'm joining the team that built Sketch for Mac!

About a year ago, I bought myself a copy of [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com).

I reviewed the app. I mentioned that, even though it had a surpisingly simple interface, there was a sheer amount of work put into the design and engineering of the app. It was clear that Sketch was a combination of effort, talent and taste— a combination that’s inimitable— and deserved the Apple Design Award of late last year. The team behind Sketch, the cohort that forged that gem of an app, was certainly the kind I would have and loved to work with.

About a month ago, I joined them.

I’m incredibly humbled to be a part of such a talented, hard-working group of people. I’m over-excited, even if this month may be my first, and I’m looking forward to the many months that will come.
