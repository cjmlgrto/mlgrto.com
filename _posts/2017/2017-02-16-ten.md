This brand new version has been in the works for a while now.

I started late October last year, scratching an itch I shouldn't have. I asked myself what the next version of my site would look like— only to become lost craning my neck during the late hour of every night building iteration upon iteration of my website redesign. 

Four months later and here we are— the apotheosis of my spare time side-project. Welcome to the tenth version of my website.

## Why

If you know me well enough, you know that I redesign my website when I feel the previous version doesn't represent who I am now. I outgrow the older designs because my motivations and inspirations become vastly different to what it was before. 

The [last redesign][previous] was built because I started Uni— dark with vibrant colors, a soft sans-serif typeface, and simple video game-like look— a reflection of my more adventurous and child-like self. This tenth version was built looking towards the future: _refined_ and much more _modern_.

I kept the dark theme for diversity; too many sites are bright these days— black on white— and it's a remnant of the days designers limited themselves to print work. The typeface I also kept as a sans-serif— [_Mallory_][mallory] by Frere-Jones. Not only does it look great, but it also was designed specifically for screens:

> Mallory was built to be a reliable tool, readily pairing with other typefaces to organize complex data and fine-tune visual identities. Each style contains over 1250 glyphs, to anticipate a wide range of content: small caps and oldstyle figures for running text, lining figures and uppercase punctuation for headlines, tabular figures and over a dozen currency symbols for financial data.

This typeface suits data, and pairs nicely with `monospace fonts`— for inline code— of which I'll be writing more about as I delve deeper into my computer science degree.

Aside from the design, there's a whole lot going on in the background. If you've noticed already, you'll see that my blog is no longer hosted on [Tumblr][tumblr]. I truly enjoyed using Tumblr, but I have outgrown its usefulness and has Tumblr has limited the way I want to build my site. So I migrated (most) of my entire site to AWS S3 as a static website— developed on top of Jekyll and GitHub. I can't stress how much easier it is now to write an art-directed blog post!

## How

Every time I redesign, I [keep promising][promise] to write about _how_ I actually built it— but I never ever have. So instead of promising, I decided to just write it right here and right now. Oh and, dear reader— read on if you're interested in the tech behind all this.

### Design

[Sketch][sketch].

### Development

I hand-coded it using a text editor, and a neat little program called [Jekyll][jekyll]. It's a static site generator. How it works: if I've got a folder full of `.html` templates and another folder of blog posts as `.md` text files organised a certain way, Jekyll will build a fully-functioning website by dropping in the content into the templates _for every_ blog post— instead of me copying and pasting the text into multiple `.html` files. It actually does so much more than that and it's really cool— and it's made development so much faster.

Also, I couldn't have built this site without `git`. It's a [version-control system][git] that allows me to keep track of multiple iterations of the website. That means, while I code the website, I can use `git` to "save" a snapshot of what my code looks like at that specific time (using the command `git add --all && git commit`) and refer to it later once I've made a significant amount of change to the code. If I decide that the changes I've made are not-so-great, I can easily revert back to that "saved" snapshot. Through GitHub, I can upload these "saved" snapshots, knowing that there's a backup on the internet in case my laptop implodes.

### Migrating Blog Posts

This couldn't been extremely difficult had I not been saving all my blog posts as `.md` files. All I did was batch-rename the files using a custom Python script, and drop them in.

### Deployment

My website is hosted on [Amazon's Simple Storage Service][s3], using [Cloudfront][cloudfront] as the CDN. Everything is `gzip` compressed, static files are caches in your browser, and it just loads so much faster than ever.

To push changes to my website, I use a command line tool called `s3_website` that you can [read more about here][s3_website]. In sum, it's a tool that selectively checks for differences between the local copy of my site and the one on Amazon, and only uploads what has been changed. Plus, it just takes one command in Terminal to update my site!

### Extra Geekery

While building my site, I wrote a [custom Jekyll plugin][plugin] converts plain old Markdown-generated `<img ../>` tags into `<figure><img .../><figcaption>...</figcaption></figure>`. It's more semantically correct, and looks much nicer on the website. On top of that, the plugin also converts the following Markdown syntax `@[caption here](youtube url here)` into a video embed.

Instead of writing plain old CSS, I used [Sass][sass] because I can define and use variables throughout my stylesheet. I also organised my CSS into modules and wrote it following the [Block-Element-Modifier][bem] naming model. It's super neat, and you can have a [look at the code on GitHub][css].

## What (next)

There's quite a bit of work to do. I'm yet to add more projects to my [portfolio][work] page, write case studies for each portfolio piece, migrate some of the older art-directed posts onto this website and so on. 

Just recently, I learned about using [Image CDNs][cdns] to minimise the loading time for my website— so I also have to implement that in the future. Plus, there's so much more I want to do— and thanks to this huge site-wide redesign, it's much easier for me to implement these new changes.

Overall, I'm really proud of this website I've built. I poured almost everything I know about design and development into this redesign. It's smarter, cleaner and much more modern. I hope you like it as much as I do.
