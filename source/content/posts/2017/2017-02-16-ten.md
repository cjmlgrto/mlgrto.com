This brand new version has been in the works for a while.

It all began late October last year, scratching an itch I shouldn't have. I asked myself what the next version of my site would look like — only to become lost craning my neck during the late hour of every night building iteration upon iteration of my next major redesign.

Four months later and here we are — the apotheosis of my spare time side-project. Welcome to the tenth version of my website.

## Why

If you know me well enough, you know that I redesign my website when I feel the previous version doesn't represent who I am now. I outgrow the older designs because my tastes, motivations and inspirations become vastly different to what it was before.

The [last redesign][previous] revolved around the time I started Uni — featuring a design that's dark with vibrant colors, a friendly sans-serif typeface and video game-like look. It was a reflection of my more adventurous and child-like self. This tenth version however, is instead built looking towards the future: _refined_ and much more _modern_.

Gone are the rich and vibrant colors, however I kept the dark theme for diversity. Too many sites are black on white these days — it's a remnant of the days designers used to work solely on print — and a dark background establishes a different context around the content compared to that of a bright one.

I also kept the sans-serif motif. The typeface you're reading this in is [Mallory][mallory] by Frere-Jones. Not only does it look great, but it was also designed specifically for screens. Here's an apt description about it direct from the source:

> Mallory was built to be a reliable tool, readily pairing with other typefaces to organize complex data and fine-tune visual identities. Each style contains over 1250 glyphs, to anticipate a wide range of content: small caps and oldstyle figures for running text, lining figures and uppercase punctuation for headlines, tabular figures and over a dozen currency symbols for financial data.

As mentioned, this typeface was designed for displaying data — and pairs nicely with `monospace fonts` for inline code. As I delve deeper into my computer science degree, I will be writing more about my findings and learnings in code.

This tenth version is more than just a mere facelift however. The biggest reason for this redesign was that I've been meaning to migrate my blog away from [Tumblr][tumblr]. It was (and still is!) a great publishing platform — I truly enjoyed using it — but it has restricted the way I've always wanted to build my website.

Now, my website is completely hosted on Amazon's [Simple Storage Service][s3] and distributed around the world using Amazon [CloudFront][cloudfront]. As a result, it's much easier for me to manage content and make changes to the websites on the fly — and it loads _so much faster_.

## How

Every time I redesign, I [keep promising][promise] to write about _how_ I built it — but I've never actually fulfilled that promise! So instead of stating another promise, I decided to write it right here and right now. So dear reader, if you're interested in the tech behind all this, read on.

### How I designed the site

[Sketch][sketch].

### How I developed the site

I hand-coded it using a text editor, building on top of a neat little static site generator called [Jekyll][jekyll]. There are a lot of really great [resources][resources] about it, but in short: it makes building a blog from scratch much faster. 

I started by writing out all the `HTML` [semantically][rwd], and then writing the `CSS` in modules using the [BEM][bem] model, pre-processed with [Sass][sass]. I fell in love with the craft of web development, and I _really_ care about web standards[^1]. I try to keep my code super neat — you can have [a look at it on GitHub][repo] if you'd like.

In the background, I've been heavily using `git` to keep my code under [version control][git]. Before the design you see here, this tenth redesign actually had over a dozen different iterations. Thanks to `git` it's made it much easier to manage every new idea for the design I've had (and I think at one point, I've had 8 different branches for totally different website designs!).

### How I migrated from Tumblr to Jekyll

I didn't use the [Jekyll Import][import] plugin — it doesn't work as well as I thought it would — plus migrating all the URLs for images on the older versions of my site needed to be done _manually_. Thankfully, I've kept all my blog posts in `.md` format over the years, so all it took was a Python script to prepare them for this new site.

### How I deployed this site to Amazon S3

There's a really great Ruby Gem called `s3_website` that [intelligently uploads files][s3_website] with just a single shell command. It's a really great tool, and it includes an option to `gzip` compress files before uploading — another reason for this site's incredible speed.

## What (next)

The site's launched, but there's quite a bit of work left to do. I need to finish the code for my [portfolio][work] (at the moment they're just images slapped on the page), write case studies for each project I've done, migrate some of the older art-directed posts onto this website, [use an Image CDN][cdn] to minimise website bandwidth, so on an so forth...

Overall however, I'm quite proud of what I've built. I poured everything I know about design and development into this redesign. Version ten is smarter, cleaner and much more modern. I hope you like it as much as I do.
