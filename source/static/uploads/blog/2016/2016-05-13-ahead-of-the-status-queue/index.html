<p>If there was one word I'd use to describe the beautifully vibrant and multicultural city that is Melbourne, it'd be <em>coffee</em>. Dark brown, caffeine-infused, broiling hot <em>coffee</em>. I often like to joke that it's the drink that powers Melbourne.</p>

<p>Today, there are more cafés <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/melbourne-cbd-is-being-swallowed-by-the-food-chain-20131201-2yjvg.html">than actual stores</a> in the city. Every suburb I visit isn't a <em>long black</em> short of serving coffee, and almost everyone I meet isn't at least a self-certified coffee connoisseur. In other words, the coffee industry is big, and a potential platform waiting to be “<a href="http://tech.co/the-uberification-of-startups-2015-11">Uber-ized</a>” by Australia's startup cult.</p>

<p>So in typical “I wish there was X” fashion, I’d say there’s a lot that can be done on top of Melbourne’s coffee culture. For me at least, I wish there was a way to peek at a café’s menu before ordering. And moreover, because I’m usually (always) in rush, I wish there was a way to pre-order a cup before I even talk to a barista.</p>

<p>And then I found <em><a href="http://www.heyyou.com.au">Hey You</a></em>.</p>


<figure class="slightly-large post-only">
	<img src="imgs/site.png"/>
</figure>

<p>Go check out their <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/beat-the-q/id480619522">app</a>— what they offer is exactly what Melbourne’s coffee industry needs. <em>Hey You</em> aims to make every café around you accessible online. It’s pretty cool, actually.</p>

<p>Through the <em>Hey You</em> app, you can <a href="https://app.heyyou.com.au">browse for cafés</a> around you and view full menus. The app also works as a <a href="http://www.heyyou.com.au/business">loyalty-rewards program</a>, which keeps track of how many times you've been to a café then automatically rewards you for visits. In other words, it's a really useful app for the intrepid coffee-lover.</p>

<p>But that's not even the best part: <em>Hey You</em> lets you <em>pre-order anything</em> through their app. Once you’ve found a café, you can pre-purchase what you want from the menu— be it coffee, tea or even a full breakfast— and then pick it up once you arrive. It’s fast, cashless, and convenient. Not to mention— an incredibly valuable business idea.</p>

<figure class="slightly-large post-only">
	<img src="imgs/order.png"/>
</figure>

<p>In fact, that’s the reason <em>Hey You</em> started out in the first place. Back then, they were known as <em><a href="https://www.beattheq.com">Beat The Q</a></em> and it was a website that allowed users to quickly buy coffee before arriving at a café. Because this was back in 2011, they were one of the first and only businesses that monetised coffee pre-ordering— way before <em>fin-tech</em> companies like <em><a href="http://mashable.com/2014/10/08/square-coffee/">Square</a></em> or even coffee-chains like <em><a href="http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/136520-you-can-now-pre-order-your-starbucks-coffee-from-an-iphone-or-android-phone-at-any-uk-branch">Starbucks</a></em> had even implemented it.</p>

<figure class="slightly-large post-only">
	<img src="imgs/three-image-2.png"/>
</figure>

<p>So, how does it all work? From what I can gather in their press releases, <em>Hey You</em>’s business <a href="http://influencing.com/au/prwire/beat-the-q-a-hit-with-busier-than-ever-aussies">runs entirely</a> on the commission model. And on the legal side of things, they’re operating as an Australian private company (I’ve written about what this means, <a href="http://log.mlgrto.com/post/141604267450/fixing-the-graphic-design-problem">a few</a> <a href="http://log.mlgrto.com/post/142767920215/how-kon-built-hope">blog posts</a> <a href="http://log.mlgrto.com/post/140780509035/the-9-billion-dollar-tech-startup">ago</a>).</p>

<p>On the <a href="http://www.startupsmart.com.au/mentor/how-do-i-set-up-a-sales-commission-structure/">commission model</a>: it works a little bit like how <em>fin-tech</em> companies do it. In exchange for $33 a month, <em><a href="http://abr.business.gov.au/SearchByAbn.aspx?abn=34144912158">Hey You PTY LTD</a></em> provides cafés with a queueing system and integrates them into their network of registered cafés. Then for every purchase done through the app, <em>Hey You</em> <a href="http://www.startupdaily.net/2013/10/why-wait-in-line-when-you-can-beat-the-q/">takes a small percentage</a>, and cafés pay for all the credit card transaction fees.</p>

<p>All in all, it’s a really clever way of managing cost and revenue. But what really piqued my interest, was their technical implementation. (If you’ll allow me to geek out a bit here...)</p>

<p>The entire system runs on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ5H8sn_2ZI">Amazon’s scalable cloud infrastructure</a>. This means that they can easily handle a huge spike in user signups (from tens to the thousands) and have the monthly fee of a single café cover the cost. </p>

<figure class="slightly-large post-only">
	<img src="imgs/three-image-1.png"/>
</figure>

<p>This cloud infrastructure is usually reserved for big data tech companies like Facebook or <a href="https://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>. But <em>Hey You</em>’s engineering team <a href="https://engineering.heyyou.io/continuous-everything-1c23bb0f6d1a">was clever enough to use it early</a>, which means very little money is burned at managing servers and software.</p>

<figure class="normal post-only">

</figure>

<p>That means <em>Hey You</em> maximises revenue not just externally through their commission model, but also internally thanks to their <a href="https://engineering.heyyou.io">engineering team</a>. This is what a lot of fledging startups need to take advantage of— especially if they’re trying to enter the tech space.</p>

<p>Engineering aside, I see an opportunity for <em>Hey You</em> to scale into fast-food outlets and other chains. There are still queues in every <em>Grill’d</em> or <em>San Churro</em> I walk into, waiting to be replaced by a pre-ordering system. <em>Hey You</em> would have to move fast however— and as <a href="http://skip.com.au">competitors</a> crop up alongside them— it won’t be long until big food franchises develop their own.</p>

<p>Since 2011, <em>Hey You</em> has reached over 500,000 users, partnered with over <a href="http://www.smartcompany.com.au/business-advice/strategy/44361-posse-and-beat-the-q-merge-to-create-new-business/">56,000 cafés</a> around Australia (and New Zealand) and has processed an average of over 400,000 transactions <em>per month</em>. And after <a href="https://info.westpac.com.au/heyyou/">Westpac’s investment and partnership</a>, they’re now a <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/beat-the-q#/entity">Series A startup</a> valued at just over $5 million dollars.</p>

<figure class="slightly-large post-only">
	<img src="imgs/three-image-3.png"/>
</figure>

<p>The secret to <em>Hey You</em>’s success isn’t just because their idea is so original. It’s because they took advantage of an existing industry and made it even better. And for us coffee-loving <em>Melbournites</em>— we’ll never have to wait in line for our coffee, ever again.</p>
