<p>There are a lot of resources on the web for <a href="https://templates.office.com/en-au/templates-for-PowerPoint">PowerPoint themes</a> and the like. Although they&#39;re there to make a stale slide-deck look more appealing, simply having nice fonts and colors won&#39;t make a presentation more engaging.</p>

<p>Although I&#39;m no expert at presentations, I consider myself a slideshow connoisseur. Ever since high school, I&#39;ve always enjoyed designing, presenting, and even watching slideshows. (If you know me well enough, you know that I&#39;m <a href="https://twitter.com/cjmlgrto/status/772275138020507648">always up at 3am</a> for Apple Keynotes). I enjoy them because I think slideshows are the perfect medium for more formal, visual storytelling.</p>

<p>Now that I&#39;m an entrepreneur, slideshows (or <em>pitch decks</em> in the startup world) have become more of a utility than an art for me. In order for a business to succeed, the quality of its slides <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-design-a-pitch-deck-lessons-from-a-seasoned-founder-c816d1ae7272#.nm04ptqdm">must be able to engage both potential investors and fans alike</a>. And to reach <em>pitch perfect</em>, slideshows require not only to be eye-catching-ly gorgeous, but must also be effective at communicating ideas.</p>

<p>While making the pitch deck for <a href="http://initiator.fund">Initiator</a> (of which I&#39;ll upload one day!), I pulled up a mood-board of <a href="https://attach.io/startup-pitch-decks/">some of the most successful slideshows</a> from Silicon Valley. I watched their presentations, looked at the pitch decks, and read <a href="https://medium.com/@collinmathilde/front-series-a-deck-f2e2775a419b#.dfu53bjku">some</a> <a href="https://blog.mixpanel.com/2014/12/18/open-sourcing-our-pitch-deck-that-helped-us-get-our-865m-valuation/">of</a> <a href="http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/youtube-receives-35m-in-funding-from-sequoia-capital-736129.htm">the</a> <a href="https://crew.co/backstage/blog/the-investor-presentation-we-used-to-raise-2-million/">founders&#39;</a> <a href="http://onstartups.com/tabid/3339/bid/98034/The-Pitch-Deck-We-Used-To-Raise-500-000-For-Our-Startup.aspx">posts</a> on which were successful and which weren&#39;t. I even got out <a href="https://twitter.com/duarte">Nancy Duarte</a>&#39;s <a href="http://www.duarte.com/book/hbr-guide-to-persuasive-presentations/"><em>HBR Guide to Persuasive Presentations</em></a> to deconstruct what I knew about designing slides.</p>

<p>For posterity, and for the purpose of helping out my colleagues who are also building pitch decks of their own, I decided to collate what I&#39;ve learned. I know, I know— it&#39;s a sin to help your competition out, but <em>in the name of design</em>, here&#39;s everything I know about how to create a slideshow that doesn&#39;t suck:</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">One Idea Per Slide</h2>

<p>The best way to illustrate this is through action: grab a thick marker and a handful of sticky notes. Before opening up your computer, <em>draw out</em> your <em>entire</em> slideshow on those sticky notes.</p>

<figure>

</figure>

<p>It can be difficult— and that&#39;s the point. If you&#39;re cramming in too much per sticky note, then the same goes for your slides. To make the process easier, limit yourself to drawing out one idea per yellow paper.</p>

<p>The above technique isn&#39;t mine— it&#39;s <a href="http://www.duarte.com/presentation-storyboarding/">Duarte&#39;s</a>— but I personally do the same for every slideshow I start. Not only does it help focus which points I&#39;m going to talk about, but also maps out the structure of my presentation.</p>

<h2 id="toc_2">Less Words, More Graphics</h2>

<p>Don&#39;t let the slides to the talking. <a href="http://v4.jasonsantamaria.com/articles/make-yourself-presentable/">It is your job to talk, and for the slides to help you with your talk</a>. So that means no paragraphs or bullet points. Maybe a sentence, at most. If you can do it in a few words, that&#39;s good. <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/chip_kidd_designing_books_is_no_laughing_matter_ok_it_is?language=en">But the quickest, most straightforward way of presenting an idea is through a picture</a>.</p>

<p>Say for example, you&#39;re pitching the idea for an app. You could put up a slide with a list of all its features, or instead show the mockup of a screen shot for the app. Sure, the latter will take longer to make, but it will let your audience instantly understand what you&#39;re trying to say.</p>

</figure>

<p>As the saying goes, a picture is worth a thousand words. Notice the word ‘worth’ in there. The right image for an idea is more valuable than any form of prose.</p>

<h2 id="toc_3">Play with the Eyes</h2>

<p>To deliver a presentation isn&#39;t just giving a speech and using the slides to show what you&#39;re talking about. Slideshows are an <em>audio-visual experience</em>. To present is to tell one story to the ears, another story for the eyes, and have the audience combine them into the idea you&#39;re trying to pitch.</p>

<p>A good sound-bite paired with a well-placed slide <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S0FDjFBj8o">can trigger a more emotional effect rather than just saying so</a>. For example, you could deliver a joke and just say the punchline. Or you could instead build up the joke, click to a slide that illustrates the punchline, and then have the audience revel in laughter.</p>

<p>It&#39;s no coincidence that it&#39;s the same move a lot of film editors use. A movie isn&#39;t exciting if it&#39;s just two characters exchanging dialogue back and forth. The same goes for a presentation— it&#39;s not at all engaging without making the most of your audience&#39;s eyes.</p>

<p>The biggest takeaway from these three points is that a great presentation takes advantage of the slides. The slides aren&#39;t there as a backdrop— they&#39;re there to complement what you want to say. </p>

<p>Pitches are <em>show and tell</em>, after all.</p>
