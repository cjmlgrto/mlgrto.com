<p>It&#39;s actually more difficult than it sounds. Why? Before I explain, I&#39;ll lay down the context.</p>

<p>Only a few weeks ago, our <a href="https://twitter.com/erinlynnaus">lecturer in entrepreneurship</a> set my classmates and I a challenge: given $5, we were to make as much money as we possibly could. The even harder challenge: we had to do it in 15 days.</p>

<p>15 days is quite a lot of time. But <em>not</em> if you&#39;re juggling three subjects as a full-time uni studentâ€” all while working as a designer for three different companies. On top of that, each of my subjects had at least one assignment due within the week (plus a topic test to study for the week after). In short: 15 days is actually not a lot of time.</p>

<p>Luckily, we didn&#39;t have to do it individually (except for one of us). We got to do it in teams. I did it alongside my current startup teamâ€” <a href="https://zacsomethingdifferent.wordpress.com">Zac</a>, <a href="https://sebcharnock.wordpress.com">Seb</a> and <a href="https://jacquiwakefield.wordpress.com">Jacqui</a>â€”Â who each wrote about their own experience of this challenge. (Go and have a read of their blogs. They&#39;re great pieces. It&#39;s okay, I&#39;ll wait right here).</p>

<p>Our plan: we would each manage a venture of our own, and cross-collaborate. We thought it was a great way to manage our resources. That is, having multiple projects run simulataneously instead of <a href="http://log.mlgrto.com/post/148478336180/startup-tips-from-unihack">having to create tasks that depended on each other</a>. It went well, and their blog posts linked above best explain each of our team&#39;s little enterprises.</p>

<p>For my project, I really wanted to take advantage of my area of expertise: software. Not just because it&#39;s something I really truly enjoy doing, but also because I thought it&#39;s the type of enterprise that would generate the most profits with very little cost. And well, I was wrong.</p>

<p>At first, I decided to do it <a href="https://glaciericons.com">Glacier</a>-style. That is, create a piece of software that my friends in the design and developer industry would buy. The problem with this however, is that creating something as valuable as Glacier would take me months to make. Even if I did it <a href="http://log.mlgrto.com/post/146601631835/ios-10-ui-kit">hackathon-style</a> with my recent release of the <a href="http://puzzles.design">iOS 10 UI templates</a>, I wouldn&#39;t have been able to do any work for days due to lack of sleep.</p>

<p>I then thought that if I couldn&#39;t fit in the time to create software, I could perhaps host an event where others would do it and pay for it. That is, I thought of hosting an afternoon-long mini-hackathon, and get past competitors to help me set it up. I even thought about giving away <a href="http://log.mlgrto.com/post/148478336180/startup-tips-from-unihack">my new Xbox</a> as a prize to lure in competitors. But hosting an event as extravagant as that would have cost me too much unnecessary effort just for the returns I&#39;d get in the end.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the biggest thing I learned from this experience: even though software costs next to nothing to sell, it can take up a whole lot of time before selling anything. <em>Time is money</em>â€” and that&#39;s something I&#39;ll always take into account from now on when it comes to running a busines.</p>

<p>A few days have since passedâ€”Â my planning was taking too longâ€” and I was running out of ideas and options. That was when I decided to host a code workshop instead. I thought that if I really wanted to sell my expertise as a developer through software, <em>what if I literally did sell my expertise?</em></p>

<p>I was unsure at first, because I only knew a handful of people that would be interested in attending such an event. I decided to launch <a href="http://indiecodeworkshop.com">a little website</a> for the event anyway, and promote it passively through social media. How it would work was I&#39;d charge $20 to reserve a spot, and I&#39;d teach them the basics in an hour.</p>

<p>After a couple of days, to my surprise, a whole lot of strangers were actually interested in attendingâ€” and even some of my peers who were adept at code <a href="https://twitter.com/joshparnham/status/763278198180225025">thought it was a great idea</a>. I then asked my friends at <a href="http://wired.org.au">Wired Students Society</a> (the people who organised <a href="http://unihack.net">UNIHACK</a>) to help me promote my event to get more people to attend.</p>

<p class="ending">I held two sessions at one of the libraries at Monash University: one on <a href="https://icw.herokuapp.com/presentation/build-your-own-website">web development</a> and the other <a href="https://icw.herokuapp.com/presentation/programming-in-python">on Python</a>. The people who came enjoyed the event, and some wanted more. And I myself enjoyed teaching and mentoring others about code. In the end, I earned $360, all of which I promised to donate to the <a href="http://log.mlgrto.com/post/142767920215/how-kon-built-hope">ASRC</a>. Overall, it was quite a successful experience.</p>
