I'm a [designer](/work) who makes icons, interfaces and websites. I also produce videos and work as a tech consultant for companies. In my spare time, I teach people how to design and code.

While I’m not working, I study computer science and maths. I’m also taking an exclusive entrepreneurial degree at [Monash University](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6HM6D0w2a8&index=2&list=PL43_xv9rfcDRFKjq7_2jq9VUsfxkxVy2D). In other words, I’m one of the few students chosen to learn leadership and business skills on top of a traditional science course.

I also co-founded [Infinifty](http://infinifty.net) — a startup that aims to help communicate complex science issues through insanely fun card games.

## Companies I've worked with

[Envato](http://envato.com), [Bohemian Coding](http://sketchapp.com), [Itty Bitty Apps](http://revealapp.com), [River SRL](http://sparkle.cx), [Art Processors](http://artprocessors.net), [8Fit](http://8fit.com), [Collective Campus](http://collectivecamp.us), [Calibre](http://calibreapp.com), [Futureye](http://futureye.com) and many more...

## About the site

This site's my humble little abode on the information superhighway — thanks for stopping by!

This tenth major version is built on top of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and set in a typeface called [Mallory](https://frerejones.com/families/mallory). You can view the source code for it on [GitHub](https://github.com/cjmlgrto/mlgrto.com).

This site started about the same time I started high school. I learned to code because I've always wanted to build myself a website. 8 years later, it's still here — and I'm still [blogging](/) about films, science, tech and design (literally anything I can geek out on).
