I'm a multidisciplinary designer and software engineer. In other words, I'm really good at drawing icons, prototyping apps, building websites, producing videos— and sometimes, I teach people how to code.

I've previously worked with the team that built [Sketch for Mac](https://sketchapp.com), became a design journalist for a while on [The Industry](http://theindustry.cc/author/cj/) and then worked as a design instructor for [Envato](https://envato.com). Currently, I'm an intern at [Collective Campus](http://www.collectivecamp.us), all the while building [a startup](http://initiator.fund) with my classmates.

While I'm not working, I study Computational Science and Maths at [Monash University](https://monash.edu). I'm also a [Global Challenges](https://www.monash.edu/global-challenges) student.

My username is usually [@cjmlgrto](https://twitter.com/cjmlgrto). Find me sharing bits of my design process through [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cjmlgrto) and [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/cjmlgrto), writing code on [GitHub](https://github.com/cjmlgrto/mlgrto.com) and taking photos of neat stuff on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/cjmlgrto). I'm also on [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/cjmlgrto), if you're feeling retro.

## About the site

When I just started high school, I learned to code because I wanted to build myself a website. 8 years later, it's still here— and I'm still [blogging](/blog) about films, science, tech and design (literally anything I can geek out on).

I [recently redesigned](#) this website. This ninth major version is built on top of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and set in a typeface called [Mallory](https://frerejones.com/families/mallory). You can view the source code for it on [GitHub](https://github.com/cjmlgrto/mlgrto.com).

This site's my humble little abode on the information superhighway— thanks for stopping by!
