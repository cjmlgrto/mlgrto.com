I'm a [designer](/work) who makes icons, interfaces and websites. I also produce videos for startups, help people build businesses and— sometimes— I teach kids how to code. Mostly however, I work as a freelance tech consultant and digital all-rounder.

While I'm not working, I study computer science and maths. I'm also taking an _exclusive_ entrepreneurial degree at [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/global-challenges). In other words, I'm one of the few students chosen to learn leadership and business skills on top of a traditional science course.

I also co-founded [a startup](http://initiator.fund) that aims to help scientists better communicate their work. It's all hush-hush for now, but all I can say is that I've taken on the role of technical director.

I believe that science and design are one and the same: equal parts experimentation, problem-solving and excitement.

## Companies I've worked with

Find me sharing bits of my design process through [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cjmlgrto) and [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/cjmlgrto), writing code on [GitHub](https://github.com/cjmlgrto/mlgrto.com) and taking photos of neat stuff on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/cjmlgrto). I'm also on [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/cjmlgrto), if you're feeling extra corporate today.

## About the site

When I just started high school, I learned to code because I wanted to build myself a website. 8 years later, it's still here— and I'm still [blogging](/) about films, science, tech and design (literally anything I can geek out on).

I [recently redesigned](/) this website. This tenth major version is built on top of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and set in a typeface called [Mallory](https://frerejones.com/families/mallory). You can view the source code for it on [GitHub](https://github.com/cjmlgrto/mlgrto.com).

This site's my humble little abode on the information superhighway— thanks for stopping by!
