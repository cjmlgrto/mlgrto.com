# mlgrto.com

Ola, amigo! This is the source code for my home on the information superhighway. Feel free to wander about, or visit the [full website](http://mlgrto.com/) in all its glory. Also, I recently redesigned this site — you can [read more about it here](http://mlgrto.com/blog/2017/ten/).

## Setup

CJ, if you're reading this — then congratulations for getting a new computer. Or, for doing a clean install of the operating system. If you're not CJ, then you're kinda awesome for checking out my site. Anyway, read on:

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `bundle install && rake setup` to install the required dependencies.
3. Then run `rake serve` to preview the site locally.
4. If you want to deploy the site, fill in the variables within your local `.env` file.
5. Then run `rake deploy` to deploy the site.
