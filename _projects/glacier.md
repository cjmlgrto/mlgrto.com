Designed over a hundred hours in total, Glacier is replacement icon set for macOS. Each icon has been meticulously created to improve over the original, while still keeping the modern minimalist look. These icons have been downloaded over 10,000 times, and have been featured on the design blog of a [former New York Times art director](https://www.subtraction.com/2015/02/19/glacier-icons/).
