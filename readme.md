## Files Inside
My goal is to keep my site as lean and clean as much as possible. There's barely anything else in here other than HTML and CSS files. Here's a little explainer of what each file is for, though:

- ``blog`` — the tumblr theme
- ``static`` — all the resources ever
- ``work`` — my portfolio page
- ``index.html`` — my info page that also serves as my homepage
