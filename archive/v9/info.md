I'm a multidisciplinary digital artist. In other words, I'm good at drawing icons, prototyping interfaces, building websites, producing videos and I sometimes teach people how to code. 

I've previously worked with the team that built [Sketch for Mac](https://sketchapp.com), worked as a design instructor for [Envato](https://envato.com), and I'm currently building [a startup](http://initiator.fund) with my classmates.

While I'm not working, I study Computational Science and Maths at [Monash University](https://monash.edu). I'm also a [Global Challenges](https://www.monash.edu/global-challenges) student.

By the way, you should [check out my blog](/blog/). I enjoy writing, and I've been running it for over 8 years now. It's mainly about things I've learned and musings about science, design, tech, movies or anything else I can geek out on.

You can find me elsewhere on the web. Mainly on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cjmlgrto), in which I chronicle my daily ramblings. You can find my work on [Github](https://github.com/cjmlgrto) or my [portfolio](/work/). I also enjoy photographyâ€” check it out on my [Instagram](https://instagram.com/cjmlgrto).

I'm usually available to work as a freelance all-around designer or tech consultant. But this month, I'm totally booked. Sorry. You can [email me](mailto:) though!
