			<h1>Steve Jobs was my inspiration.</h1>
		
			<div>
				<p>I remember the first time I saw Steve. He looked old, and unshaven. He wasn't wearing a business suit nor did he look formal. He was sporting what looked like a black turtleneck, some Levi jeans and grey sneakers. This, of course, was during the WWDC 2010 keynote, and it was one of the first keynotes I've ever watched.</p>
		
				<p>He looked enthusiastic up on stage. He also looked like one of those rag-dolls you dress up, because of that (what looked to be) over-sized turtleneck he was wearing. I once called him 'the humble CEO' because of what he wore, but I then found out later that that wasn't the reason he wears that same costume almost everyday.</p>	
				
				<!-- <img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/15461520/tumblr/Steve.png" /> -->
		
				<p>I then watched the entire keynote. His unveiling was superb, and his presentation skills were excellent. The way he talked about the iPhone 4's new features looked like he was a true fan of his own work. He looked like a kid who got a new box of toys that would have loved to show them around to the whole of the neighbourhood. It was this thrill, and his enthusiasm that drove me closer towards Apple.</p>	
		
				<p>It was from then on, (and after a few more Apple keynotes), I knew that Steve Jobs was my idol.</p>
		
				<p>I started talking about Macs more, I began to admire Apple's taste for design, I read a lot and discovered various blogs, news websites, podcasts and videos, and most of all, I began to draw myself closer and closer to technology.</p>
		
				<p>The idea of writing myself a blog then followed a month after the iPhone 4 keynote, and of course, perks like 'interweb promotion' and Dribbble invites began to follow.</p>
		
				<p>Months then passed, products launched, and of course, more of Jobs' inspiring keynotes then followed. Soon, the news about Steve stepping down from his role as Apple's CEO broke, and that's when I knew that Steve had little time left. (Of course, I knew this because of his publicly spoken-of medical leaves and hiatuses that seemed to relate to his Cancer diagnosis he spoke about back in his 2005 Stanford commencement address.)</p>
		
				<p>A few more weeks passed, and soon, the sum of all my fears began to dawn on me: I started hearing rumours about Steve's death. I then confirmed the startling truth through Twitter, various blogs, and the Apple website itselfâ€“and that's when I read it through a press release while digging through press images of the Apple event that happened the night before.</p>
		
				<p>For a man I never really met in person, I actually felt really sad hearing the news about his passing.</p>
		
				<p>Steve Jobs was one of the crazy ones. He thought different, he brought a once soon-to-be bankrupt company to the ruler of the technology market. He made Apple decide what's cool and what's not in the tech market. He's said inspirational quotes. He changed who I am as a person. And most importantly, <em>he changed the world</em>.</p>
