<h2><i>CJ Melegrito</i> is in three parts a student, a writer, and a designer.</h2>
<p>Curious, light-hearted, and willing to learn, CJ Melegrito is a true student. He often refers to himself as a <i>Gestalt Ingenieur</i> which, literally translated from German, means <i>Shape-Engineer</i>. He believes that every challenge is malleable and he can impose a shape upon them through design. He’s also a member of the <a href="http://www.agda.com.au" target="_blank">Australian Graphic Design Association</a>, and an Apple fan.</p>

<h2>Etymology of <i>The Backlog</i></h2>
<p>The Backlog is CJ Melegrito’s home on the internet. In other words, it’s a place for him to write about his thoughts, give off his opinion, and rant about things.</p>
<p>This site is running on <a href="http://tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>, hosted by <a href="http://aws.amazon.com">Amazon S3</a>, and was built with <a href="http://macrabbit.com/espresso">Espresso 2</a> on <a href="http://apple.com/mac">a Mac</a> (though, that doesn’t mean you can’t build a great website on its counterpart). The main typeface used on this site is <i>Elena</i>, designed by Nicole Dotin, available at the <a href="http://processtypefoundry.com/fonts/elena/">Process Type Foundry</a>.</p> 
<p>As for the term <i>The Backlog</i>, it was originally meant to be a combination of the phrases <i>back-end</i> and <i>weblog</i>. It was just a crazy coincidence that the word <i>backlog</i> meant <i>a collection of things</i>.</p>
