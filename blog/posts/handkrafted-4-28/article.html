<p>It's hard to find great, custom-built furniture.</p>

<p>Well, I could go to <em>IKEA</em>. But whenever I visit that place, I always feel like I'm entering a factory of mass-produced, flimsy furniture. I could visit other retailers, but I have to travel to <em>far too many</em> places that are <em>too far</em> just to browse.</p>

<p>And if I still can't find anything I like, there's also the option of calling up interior design studios and asking them to build me my own. But the prices in that market <em>range in the millions</em>.</p>

<p>And then there's <em><a href="https://www.handkrafted.com">Handkrafted</a></em>. It's an online community for custom-built furniture. But unlike other retailers, they offer bespoke furniture at <em>sensible</em> prices. <a href="http://handkrafted.com">Just visit the site</a>, and see what I mean.</p>

<p>Unlike most online homeware stores (or any, for that matter), Handkrafted focuses on connecting the mass-market with skilled artisans and custom-built high-class furniture. Basically, it's a two way marketplace: craftspeople <a href="https://www.handkrafted.com/interested-makers">can sell their products online</a>, <em>or</em>— this is great— get commissioned to build tailored ones.</p>

<p>Independent makers like woodworkers, metallurgists, or even the small family furniture business can sign up and sell via the <a href="https://www.handkrafted.com/explore/products">online store</a>— a little like selling through eBay. But if you're looking for your own custom couch, table or cutlery, you can <a href="https://www.handkrafted.com/projects/new">post a brief</a>. All you have to do is list the specifics of what you want, and Handkrafted will connect you with an artisan willing to build it.</p>

<p>The products Handkrafted offers are <em><a href="https://www.handkrafted.com/jdleefurniture/1506204/stoke-daybed">extremely aesthetically pleasing</a></em>, and I like the fact that their branding centers on this. </p>

<p>Handkrafted is quite a fresh take on selling homeware online— making custom-built quality furniture no longer exclusive to the wealthy. And the fact that it's giving a platform for indie makers to sell makes it altogether an enticing marketplace.</p>

<p><a href="http://abncheck.com.au/abn/51166700803">Handkrafted Pty Ltd</a> started in Sydney on February 2014 with a seed funding of about <a href="http://www.startupsmart.com.au/advice/funding/crowdsourcing-startup-handkrafted-secures-100000-from-sydney-seed-fund/">$100,000</a>. Their current business model is like that of <a href="https://www.etsy.com">Etsy</a>'s— provide an online <a href="https://www.shopify.ca">CMS</a> for makers and consumers to interact with, while taking a percentage commission for every purchase. In other words, they operate like an <a href="https://www.shopify.com.au/blog/17240328-how-to-choose-an-ecommerce-business-model">eCommerce business</a>.</p>

<p>Essentially, they have two customers: those looking to buy furniture, and those looking to sell. Handkrafted would act as the medium between them, while handling payments, material sourcing, marketing, communication and shipping.</p>

<figure class="right-floater post-only">
	<img src="http://mlgrto.com/posts/handkrafted-4-28/imgs/maker.jpg">
</figure>

<p>On revenue streams: consumers can buy products in the traditional way, otherwise pay a bit extra when they prefer to build custom. On the makers' side of things, they can sign up for free, or pay a <a href="http://help.handkrafted.com/hc/en-us/articles/204720560-What-is-a-Premium-maker-profile-">monthly premium</a> to get better visibility and publicity on their website.</p>

<p>All in all, Handkrafted is essentially a marketplace for independent craftspeople to sell their talents, while operating as an online furniture retailer.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, because there is <a href="http://www.ibisworld.com.au/industry/default.aspx?indid=411">very little demand for furniture</a> by Australian consumers, they're yet to gain any heavy traction. What's keeping them from scaling is their appeal to a small target audience.</p>

<p>So Handkrafted has been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0rvIBa3Pgc">partnering with other companies</a> to promote their public image. Although the video above is an ad for wine, you can get a sense of their passion and the way they feel about handcrafted goods. </p>

<p>But Handkrafted doesn't sell furniture for the sake of it. Their real purpose, <a href="https://www.handkrafted.com/about">according to founder Fred Kimel</a>, is to inspire society into a more ‘<em>conscious consumerism</em>’.</p>

<figure class="slightly-large post-only">

</figure>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/handkraftedco">Fred Kimel</a> built Handkrafted because wants people to “<em>buy less, and buy well</em>”. He wants a world where <a href="http://www.afr.com/it-pro/handkrafted-founder-fred-kimels-journey-from-macquarie-bank-to-the-maker-movement-20150112-12mphj">people choose to buy things that last</a>, understand the story behind the products they buy, and rid of today's ignorant throwaway attitudes.</p>

<p>It's a great cause, and I believe Handkrafted chose the right market for their purpose. Furniture is supposed to last for years, but they've found that a lot of the cheap, poor-quality homeware the people buy today <a href="https://blog.handkrafted.com/landfill-australias-underground-furniture-movement/">end up in landfills</a> due to damage.</p>

<p>Aside from a focus on producing durable products, Handkrafted is <a href="https://www.handkrafted.com/why-handkrafted">responsible</a> for sourcing and providing sustainable materials. They're working with companies like <a href="http://secondorigin.com.au">Second Origin</a> to reuse old timber and provide recycled hardwood. And for every woodworked item they sell, <a href="https://greenmagazine.com.au/handkrafted/">they plant 50 trees</a> as a part of managing their carbon footprint.</p>

<figure class="slightly-large post-only">
	<img src="http://mlgrto.com/posts/handkrafted-4-28/imgs/wood.jpg">
</figure>

<p>I see an opportunity for Handkrafted to fully move towards recycling as a major part of their business. They could offer to <a href="https://www.handkrafted.com/reclaimiture">accept damaged furniture and re-purpose them</a> into new well-designed products. </p>

<p>That way, customers only have to pay for the labour and get professional craftspeople to make once flimsy furniture look great and last longer.</p>

<p>Furniture is meant to be passed down from generation to generation— and that's why Handkrafted puts time-honoured labour on a pedestal. For them, it means they can build a society rid of disposable products. And for me, it means I don't ever have to visit <em>IKEA</em>.</p>
