<p>When I’m tired, stressed, or looking for a way out from the challenges of life and labour, I turn to my hobbies. Having a hobby is a productive act: not only does it relieve stress, but it also allows you to learn, and more prominently, helps you grow.</p>

<p>Sport’s a great example of a hobby (that my parents wanted me to do). But as a kid, I never really fit into the sports scene. The idea of sweating it out “for fun” didn’t fascinate me until my late teens. Instead, I grew up indoors, buried in books, films, gadgets and art.</p>

<p>I grew up to hobby as a geek. But what does it mean to grow up as a geek, and how does it work? Well...</p>

<p><span class="lead">Step one</span>: <em>watch a lot of movies</em>. Movies delight and engage people more than books can. Movies bring people away from the world around them, and take them to places unimaginable. They’re a visual spectacle— and films have mesmerised me ever since I first saw a <em>lightsaber</em>.</p>

<p>Here’s the thing about movies: behind all that glitz and glamour, there’s a story to be told and passed on to you. When <em>Yoda</em> sermons <em>Luke</em> about trusting himself through <em>The Force</em>, he's actually <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMUKGTkiWik">giving valuable life lessons</a>. Films bring you experiences— <em>and you learn from those stories</em>.</p>

<p><span class="lead">Step two</span>: <em>play with a lot gadgets</em>. Video games are one thing, but dismantling calculators is another. Gadgetry is the cornerstone of modern technology: to be a technology enthusiast is to be an advocate for the future.</p>

<p>For the uninitiated, it can be puzzling to fall in love with software and circuitry. But here's a speed-date tip: watch how a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGcoIue1Bs8">watch</a> works. It's amazing to see that something seemingly magical is merely wit at work.</p>

<p>To solve complex problems, you break it down into smaller, more manageable chunks. <em>The intricate, trivial challenges thrown by modern tech become the stepping stones for the far greater challenges in life</em>.</p>

<p><span class="lead">Step three</span>: art. Lots of art. This last one's a no-brainer— semi-literally. With all the knowledge gained from the lore of films and tech, art's a great way to experiment and explore yourself. </p>

<p>Art is everywhere. Make music, write books, direct a film, build a clock— <em>what you make is what you've learned</em>.</p>

<p>In middle-school nomenclature, being a geek means getting so lost to fantasy to the point of obsession. (It’s a little exaggerated, but I can agree with that). However, I think being a geek means much more— and I've learnt <em>so much</em> growing up as one.</p>

<p>I don't believe that to hobby as a geek is about ridding yourself from reality. I believe that to geek out is to observe, interpret and understand problems from a different view— a “balcony” view <cite><a href="#fn1">(Heifetz, Grashow &amp; Linsky 2009)</a></cite>.</p>

<p>It's like <em>Jedi</em> training, but for <em>life</em>...</p>
