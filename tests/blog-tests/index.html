					<h1><a href="#">Geeking Out: A How-To Guide</a></h1>

					<div class="content">
						<p>When I’m tired, stressed, or looking for a way out from the challenges of life and labour, I turn to my hobbies. Having a hobby is a productive act: not only does it relieve stress, but it also allows you to learn, and more prominently, helps you grow.</p>

					<h1><a href="#">Stephen Colbert's Sharp Comedy</a></h1>

					<div class="content">
						<p>Elon Musk. Tim Cook. Ban Ki-Moon. Malala Yousafzai. These are names normally featured on TED talks, or conferences exclusive to the meritocratically elite. But these names have been appearing increasingly on average late-night TV— and it’s thanks to one Stephen Colbert.</p>

						<p>The state of late night TV— or TV in general, <em>per se</em>— often heralds actors, actresses and their junk of “celebrity gossip”. For those looking to stare dull before the screen, it makes for great, <em>empty</em>, light-hearted entertainment. But for those looking for entertainment that’s more meaningful, TV’s been the thing to avoid.</p>

						<p>Colbert’s new show rids of those hollow TV personalities, and presents to the general public a class of characters with <em>authenticity</em>. In an <a href="#">interview with Fast Company</a>, executive producer Emily Lazar explains:</p>

						<blockquote>
							<p>“If you have ideas, or if you have interests, or you have a body of knowledge that is genuine, that you have committed your life to, we are infinitely interested in that,” Lazar says. “Because at the end of the day, Stephen has to talk to a person and that person has to represent their ideas and their beliefs and their motivation persuasively. We’re looking for authenticity like everyone else.”</p>
						</blockquote>

						<p>It’s great to see Colbert re-wire (<em>and perhaps subtly educate the viewers of</em>) TV talk shows. If you’re looking to check what his show is all about, <a href="#">clicking the link above</a> should be a good place to start.</p>

						<p>This is Casey Neistat— and don’t be fooled by the simplicity of his video above. I’ve been following this journalist-turned-filmmaker on YouTube via his <a href="#">daily Vlog</a>, and I’ve got to say, his videos have inspired me to start one myself.</p>

						<p>There are many like this, but the video above has resonated with me so well, and has been my favourite of his so far. Great stuff.</p>
