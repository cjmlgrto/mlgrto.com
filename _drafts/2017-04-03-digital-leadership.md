Just a few weeks ago, I was invited by Dr. Rowan Brookes as a guest speaker for one of Monash University's Global Challenges workshops. In these workshops, students are taught everything from science communication, entrepreneurship, science in policy to speakership and leadership. As a student of these classes, I've always enjoyed the topics taught. They're insightful, professionally practical, and as a plus, the non-traditional methods of teaching have spoilt us from our university lectures of the norm.

Which is why I felt incredibly humbled when Dr. Brookes asked me to host the entire 3-hour workshop with her first-year students. I've taught many classes before — professionally and sometimes as a volunteer — but I never expected I'd be the one to write the syllabus for a class I've always revered.

For this workshop, I was tasked to deliver everything I knew about _Digital Leadership_. In particular, Dr. Brookes had asked me to teach students about social media ettiquette, building a professional brand online, and how to establish a digital presence. 

These were things I knew I was good at, but I've never stopped to think about how anyone was supposed to do it. Is there a right way to go about building a brand online? Where do I find the seemingly unwritten rules of social media ettiquette? How does one fulfill a digital presence? And most importantly, what is _Digital Leadership_?

## What isn't Digital Leadership

Besides long-distance communication, the most powerful thing about the internet is that you can be whoever you want to be. This power is easy to wield — easy to abuse — and the worst thing you can do is build a fake persona around yourself. 

I've seen this before (and I'll admit, I've done this once, long ago) and it always ends up _bad_. You're not only lying to those around you, (perhaps even, those who look up to you) but you're also lying to yourself. If you're not an entrepreneur, don't call yourself one. If you're not a celebrity, don't act like one. Although it's fun to project an image of what you hope to be, it's not the same as actually striving for it. What then if people see the dissonance between the _online_ you and the _real_ you? It'll all crumble eventually.

## What is Digital Leadership?

It's about building an **honest reflection of yourself** online, and using your **talent**, **influence** and **skills** to **help others**. This definition can be split into two key parts: _being honest_ and _helping others_.

### How to Be Yourself on the Internet

This may seem trivial, but for many it's quite difficult because of the pressure to act incredibly professional online.
