<p>Designing is a fun, challenging and rewarding process, and I&#39;m surprised I don&#39;t write about it that often on my blog. So for this post, I decided to journal my creative process and share with you what I&#39;ve learned while working on the design for my team&#39;s new startup, <a href="http://initiator.fund"><em>Initiator</em></a>.</p>

<p>A little bit about this new startup: <a href="http://initiator.fund"><em>Initiator</em></a> is a crowdfunding website for science research. Yes, it sounds a <a href="https://walacea.com">little bit familiar</a>‚Äî but my team and I are aiming to create a more engaged platform-slash-community for science fans of all kinds. That gave me a design challenge: we needed to be different, and removed from all the negative stigma associated with monotony of science research.</p>

<p>Above are the screen shots of our competitors&#39; websites. They&#39;ve got quite decent designs, but there&#39;s a clear pattern here: they all look very academic and formal. This gave us an opportunity to differentiate: we could give our company a distinctly different personality‚Äî¬†a unique company voice.</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Choose A Company Voice</h2>

<p>If you&#39;ve got a startup, choosing a company voice is going to be one of the biggest decisions your startup will ever make. It is really important to find a personality that best suits your company, because how you present yourself will make a lasting impression on how your customers will think of you.</p>

<p>Now what exactly is a <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/243385">‚Äúcompany voice‚Äù</a>? It&#39;s the way you behave, the way your words are written on your website, or even the way your TV ads could sound like. Your company voice is the answer to the question, ‚ÄúIf my startup were a person, what would their characteristics be?‚Äù</p>

</figure>

<p>During our team&#39;s design process, this was the first question we asked. We wanted <a href="http://initiator.fund"><em>Initiator</em></a>¬†to present science in an entirely non-traditional way.</p>

<p>We took cues from popular science communicators like <a href="http://kurzgesagt.org"><em>Kurzgesagt</em></a>, the way <a href="https://twitter.com/slackhq"><em>Slack</em></a> talks in social media, and so on.</p>

<figure class="twit">
	<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In case you missed it, we added a new way of catching up on unread channels, and it‚Äôs basically the cats pajamas. üê±üçïüé∏<a href="https://t.co/0XoOhGqR2D">https://t.co/0XoOhGqR2D</a></p>&mdash; Slack (@SlackHQ) <a href="https://twitter.com/SlackHQ/status/776208536833359872">September 14, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>What really helped us find our company identity though, was we took <a href="https://sebcharnock.wordpress.com">each</a> <a href="https://zacsomethingdifferent.wordpress.com">of</a> <a href="https://jacquiwakefield.wordpress.com">our</a> individual personalities and mixed them together. As a team, we were geeky, fun, casual and quirky. This was the kind of voice we wanted to project.</p>

<p>For some startups, it&#39;s fairly obvious to see that a company&#39;s personality can come directly from their founders. But it doesn&#39;t have to be that way: a great counter-example is <a href="http://nike.com"><em>Nike</em></a>, whose personality instead <a href="http://602communications.com/2013/02/nike-brand-strategy-emotional-branding-using-the-story-of-heroism/">took cues from their target audience</a> (highly determined athletes).</p>

<p>The next step in the design process, is finding out how to build around the voice. So, how does one go about using the voice to design a brand from scratch? Easy: you <em>don&#39;t</em> start from scratch.</p>

<h2 id="toc_2">Inspire Yourself</h2>

<p>I&#39;ve mentioned this <a href="http://log.mlgrto.com/post/148478336180/startup-tips-from-unihack">so many times before</a> on my blog: <em>nothing is truly original</em>. Like a famous painter once said, <a href="http://steallikeanartist.com">&quot;great artists steal&quot;</a>.</p>

<p>But I don&#39;t mean you should blatantly steal designs from brands. Doing so simply makes your brand forgettable. If you want to create a company brand that&#39;s truly unique and timeless, you have to steal from the best, <em>then make it your own</em>.</p>

<p>Once you&#39;ve decided on your company voice, you can use it to your advantage. Using this specific voice, find brands from entirely different industries that share the same voice as your company&#39;s. In fact, make it a team exercise: create a mood-board of things that delight you.</p>

<p>That&#39;s exactly what I did for my team. We worked with our ‚Äúquirky‚Äù personality to find visual elements we liked. I hunted for logos from <em>Disney</em> movies, illustrations from designers I looked up to, and a whole bunch more. We ended up with what you see above: a mood-board of inspiration for our company logo.</p>

<h2 id="toc_3">And Finally, Execute</h2>

<p>This is the part a lot of people shy away from, and that&#39;s learning how to use software like Photoshop to build the final designs. Here&#39;s a pro tip: you don&#39;t even need fancy software to design your logo. If you truly want to be creative, you have to think outside the box, and use what you know!</p>

<p>I&#39;ll leave the rest as an exercise for you to sharpen your skills. There are a lot of resources available on the web too, if you really want to learn how to do it digitally. Alternatively, if you want to skip the learning and have it done ASAP, you can also <a href="mailto:cj@mlgrto.com?subject=Design%20Work">hire me</a>!</p>

<p>Below is the final logo and marketing material. I&#39;ll let the them do the rest of the talking. In the meantime, <a href="http://initiator.fund">subscribe to the mailing list</a> if you want more behind-the-scenes pieces like these!</p>
