<p>Graphic design software <em>isn’t beautiful</em>.</p>

<p>Their interfaces look bloated and overtly complex. There are useless and out-dated panels <em>everywhere</em>. Ambiguous icons clutter the screen, and digging through submenus <em>buried within submenus</em> is a few sand grains short of an archaeological dig.</p>

<p>It’s a <a href="http://log.maniacalrage.net/tagged/cscr">complete <em>mess</em></a>— and it’s no wonder, that for many first-timers, learning tools like Photoshop or InDesign can be extremely frustrating. In fact, there are <a href="https://envato.com"><em>entire industries</em></a> that make (<em>a lot of</em>) money by teaching people who are technically incapable.</p>

<p>That said, there’s a wall of complexity preventing the masses from designing. For <a href="https://www.canva.com">Canva</a> CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/melaniecanva">Melanie Perkins</a>, this is the graphic design problem that needs to be fixed. Her solution? To rethink and <em>rebuild</em> design apps <em>from the ground up</em>.</p>

<p>Perkins’ idea for better design tools started way back in 2007. As a Photoshop tutor, <a href="https://about.canva.com/story/">she found</a> that it took students entire semesters to reach designs that were just close to looking professional. She also found that current design tools were too expensive, and didn’t allow for collaboration.</p>

<p>This motivated Perkins enough to partner with <a href="https://twitter.com/cliffobrecht">Cliff Obrecht</a> and start <a href="http://www.fusionyearbooks.com">Fusion Books</a>— their first proof-of-concept for an easy-to-use online design app. It allowed high school students to work together to create, design and publish yearbooks.</p>

<p>It was then a few years later that Perkins <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBdiPFfo-3A">thought</a> the technology they’ve built could be sold to a wider audience. Early 2012, Perkins <a href="http://her.yourstory.com/melanie-perkins-1102">took a trip</a> to Silicon Valley to find out more about the growing startup industry, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzaKLph9Bdc">pitch forward the idea</a> of an easy-to-use design tool.</p>

<p>While in San Francisco, Perkins noticed that most startups in <em>The Valley</em> put their company’s focus on alluring investors. Perkins <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com.au/here-are-5-lessons-an-australian-startup-ceo-has-learnt-since-launching-canva-2014-5">believed</a> that to truly attain success, a company has to <em>find the right people</em>, and solve user problems first over anything.</p>

<p>Because of this, she unconventionally decided to pitch to <em>engineers</em> before investors. Perkins <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com.au/this-bizarre-recruitment-pitch-deck-convinced-a-senior-google-engineer-to-leave-for-an-australian-start-up-2013-8#savedave-16">managed to convince</a> the then-lead Google Maps software developer <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/lars-rasmussen#/entity">Lars Rasmussen</a> to get his colleagues to build the beginnings of her vision: <a href="http://canva.com">Canva</a>.</p>

<p>This is Canva. It’s an online drag-and-drop design tool that allows <em>anyone</em> to create posters, invitations, social media share-ables and more. That’s it— there’s nothing to it really, because Canva is as simple as it sounds— and that’s what <em>genius</em> about it. <a href="https://www.canva.com">Go ahead and sign up</a>.</p>

<p>On the business-side though, Canva is <a href="http://log.mlgrto.com/post/140780509035/the-9-billion-dollar-tech-startup">a(nother)</a> Sydney-based startup with offices in The US and The Philippines. They’re an <a href="http://abr.business.gov.au/SearchByAbn.aspx?abn=80158929938">Australian Private Company</a>— that is, they’ve got no shares— and <a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/in-depth/cracking-the-code/startups-canvas-230m-designs-on-global-domination/news-story/6e8e4ac837ff8f04a99cf98a62f441f7">according to Perkins</a>, an IPO isn’t on the roadmap yet. In my opinion however, based <a href="http://www.adnews.com.au/news/the-enviable-aussie-startup-canva-on-the-precipice-of-10m-users">on their huge growth rate</a>, it’s going to happen very, very soon.</p>

<p>Revenue-wise, Canva’s early round of funding has been backed by many of <em>The Valley</em>’s <a href="http://delimiter.com.au/2013/03/20/pre-launch-web-startup-canva-raises-3m/">angel investors</a> and even <a href="http://www.smartcompany.com.au/growth/48650-canva-raises-us15-million-melanie-perkins-reveals-the-next-product-and-what-s-important-in-growing-a-business/">some A-list celebrities</a>. Right now, most of the money that flows into Canva comes from its freemium-subscription tier and a uniquely new content licensing system.</p>

<p>Canva is free for most users, but some of the content  isn’t. The photos, icons, fonts and layouts that you see in Canva <a href="https://about.canva.com/contributors">come from</a> stock sites and contributors. At a $1 per template or high-res image, users can increase the quality of their designs.</p>

<p>But what makes Canva so successful isn’t just the software, cost structure or revenue stream. It’s the way they bring users onboard. Have a look:</p>

<p>Their target market is focused on non-designers. Not a single person in the video above is a graphic designer. Canva’s marketing and user <a href="http://www.appvirality.com/blog/canva-growth-story/">on-boarding strategy</a> shows that <em>anyone</em> can create slick, professional-looking designs <em>without any technical ability</em>.</p>

<p>In fact, straight-after sign-up, there’s <a href="http://www.afr.com/p/technology/learn_graphic_design_in_seconds_l7idQ0TwMyTYBEFggD0CfP">a 23-second primer</a> on basic graphic design (echoing from Perkins’ early career as a tutor). Canva <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/b/71ce8cc2-e6f5-4dfc-b949-e7747191ce91">empowers people into design</a>— it sells them a chance to be creative, and reward them for it with quality work. This is why Canva has reached nearly <a href="https://about.canva.com/our-story/">10 million users</a> in just 3 years.</p>

<figure class="more-large post-only">

<p>Although they’re <a href="http://www.startupsmart.com.au/growth/could-canva-be-australias-first-unicorn-company/2014101313406.html">on their way</a> to becoming one of Australia’s most successful startups, there’s always room for them to grow. I feel as though Canva can make much more of an impact if they collaborated with the <a href="https://www.designernews.co">online design community</a>. Or perhaps, extended their functionality to building simple websites or mock-designing mobile apps.</p>

<p>As a <a href="http://mlgrto.com/work">graphic designer</a> and <a href="http://tutsplus.com/authors/cj-melegrito">tutor</a> myself, I think Canva is a really ingenious business. There's this exclusivity surrounding professional designers and their skillset. It's about time someone disrupted the status quo— and Canva's the one that breaks that <a href="https://daneden.me/2014/06/28/design-elitism/">fine art elitism</a>.</p>

<p>For all its worth, <a href="https://twitter.com/melaniecanva">Melanie Perkins</a> took advantage of a necessity by providing the solution to an obvious problem. <a href="http://canva.com">Canva</a> sells and enables creativity to those who couldn't find it before— all the while making graphic design software (<em>rightfully</em>) beautiful to use.</p>
