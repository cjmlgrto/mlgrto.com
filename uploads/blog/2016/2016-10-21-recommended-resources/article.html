<p>In the startup world, competition is fierce. That&#39;s the biggest thing I&#39;ve learned this semester. There isn&#39;t a niche of the enterprising industry without founders fighting over funding or a slice of the market. It&#39;s a jungle out there.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve started to notice this not only in the brands I follow, but also within my <a href="http://www.monash.edu/science/future-students/global-challenges"><em>Global Challenges</em></a> cohort. Ever since we&#39;ve been <a href="http://log.mlgrto.com/post/140386384895/globalhungerhack-i-spent-the-entirety-of-the">tasked to start startups</a>, I&#39;ve found myself in a constant state of <a href="http://log.mlgrto.com/post/149162294165/how-to-start-a-code-workshop-business-in-15-days">trying to outwit my classmates</a>. Maybe it&#39;s just me— or maybe it&#39;s because we&#39;re naturally just an ultra-competitive bunch. But I&#39;d like to think that we&#39;ve become more feisty as budding entrepreneurs.</p>

<p>What&#39;s great about competition though is that it&#39;s there to push us and motivate us to success. Ideas <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/280994">only get stronger if they&#39;re battle-tested</a>. But what&#39;s not great is that it <a href="http://blog.offscreenmag.com/post/140673646321/the-web-is-a-mindset">fosters the practice of hoarding talent and resources</a> just to keep that competitive advantage. </p>

<p>As a student, being able to out-manoeuvre my peers with what I have is a skill I&#39;ve developed over the years. It makes sense given that we&#39;re ranked, tested and compared with one another. But <a href="https://tutsplus.com/authors/cj-melegrito">as a teacher</a>, this spirit of competition is something I&#39;m still coming to terms with, because I&#39;ve learned that <a href="https://crew.co/backstage/blog/teaching-what-you-know/">there&#39;s so much more value in sharing what you know</a>— that is, to help others succeed, too.</p>

<p>In spite of all this, I&#39;ve decided to share my most valuable startup resources. This list of websites, podcasts, videos and tools are treasures I&#39;ve collected over the years during my near-decade of work in the tech industry. They&#39;ve helped me immensely <a href="http://mlgrto.com/work">in my career</a>— and I hope it does the same for you.</p>

<ul>
<li>In the above video, Cabel Sasser, founder of <a href="https://panic.com">Panic, Inc</a>. talks about how he turned a hobby into a business. I watch this talk at least once a year to motivate me in my career in tech.</li>
<li><a href="se">Small Empires</a>— A really good web series about what enterprises in the US are like. Gives a pretty good indication of startup culture.</li>

<h2 id="toc_3">🛠 Tools</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.sketchapp.com">Sketch</a>— like <a href="https://www.canva.com">Canva</a>, but for grown-ups. It&#39;s like the drawing feature of Word or Keynote, but built as its own app. Highly recommended.</li>
<li><a href="https://startup-victoria.typeform.com/to/qo53Ly">Startup Victoria Slack</a>— ok, this isn&#39;t a tool, but I use it like one. It&#39;s about 1200 members of Victoria&#39;s startup community, from founders, CEOs to job recruiters. I used it to score two jobs and an internship. As of writing, they&#39;re giving away tickets to pitch competitions to students.</li>
<li><a href="https://gumroad.com">Gumroad</a>— sell stuff with just a link. You can use it for everything, from selling digital goods, subscriptions, or even physical products. It&#39;s super easy to use.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gosquared.com">GoSquared</a>— use this instead of Google Analytics. It&#39;s way easier to set up, and so much easier to understand. And it looks way more beautiful, too.</li>
</ul>
