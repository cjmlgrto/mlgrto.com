# Hey You!

If there was one word I'd use to describe the beautifully vibrant and multicultural city that is Melbourne, it'd be *coffee*. Dark brown, caffeine-infused, broiling hot *coffee*. I often like to joke that it's the drink that powers Melbourne.

Today, there are more cafés [than actual stores](http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/melbourne-cbd-is-being-swallowed-by-the-food-chain-20131201-2yjvg.html) in the city. Every suburb I visit isn't a *long black* short of serving coffee, and almost everyone I meet isn't at least a self-certified coffee connoisseur. In other words, the coffee industry is big, and a potential platform waiting to be “[Uber-ized](http://tech.co/the-uberification-of-startups-2015-11)” by Australia's startup cult.

So in typical “I wish there was X” fashion, I’d say there’s a lot that can be done on top of Melbourne’s coffee culture. For me at least, I wish there was a way to peek at a café’s menu before ordering. And moreover, because I’m usually (always) in rush, I wish there was a way to pre-order a cup before I even talk to a barista.

And then I found *[Hey You](http://www.heyyou.com.au)*.

Go check out their [app](https://itunes.apple.com/app/beat-the-q/id480619522)— what they offer is exactly what Melbourne’s coffee industry needs. *Hey You* aims to make every café around you accessible online. It’s pretty cool, actually.

Through the *Hey You* app, you can [browse for cafés](https://app.heyyou.com.au) around you and view full menus. The app also works as a [loyalty-rewards program](http://www.heyyou.com.au/business), which keeps track of how many times you've been to a café then automatically rewards you for visits. In other words, it's a really useful app for the intrepid coffee-lover.

But that's not even the best part: *Hey You* lets you *pre-order anything* through their app. Once you’ve found a café, you can pre-purchase what you want from the menu— be it coffee, tea or even a full breakfast— and then pick it up once you arrive. It’s fast, cashless, and convenient. Not to mention— an incredibly valuable business idea.

In fact, that’s the reason *Hey You* started out in the first place. Back then, they were known as _[Beat The Q](https://www.beattheq.com)_ and it was a website that allowed users to quickly buy coffee before arriving at a café. Because this was back in 2011, they were one of the first and only businesses that monetised coffee pre-ordering— way before *fin-tech* companies like _[Square](http://mashable.com/2014/10/08/square-coffee/)_ or even coffee-chains like *[Starbucks](http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/136520-you-can-now-pre-order-your-starbucks-coffee-from-an-iphone-or-android-phone-at-any-uk-branch)* had even implemented it.

So, how does it all work? From what I can gather in their press releases, *Hey You*’s business [runs entirely](http://influencing.com/au/prwire/beat-the-q-a-hit-with-busier-than-ever-aussies) on the commission model. And on the legal side of things, they’re operating as an Australian private company (I’ve written about what this means, [a few](http://log.mlgrto.com/post/141604267450/fixing-the-graphic-design-problem) [blog posts](http://log.mlgrto.com/post/142767920215/how-kon-built-hope) [ago](http://log.mlgrto.com/post/140780509035/the-9-billion-dollar-tech-startup)).

On the [commission model](http://www.startupsmart.com.au/mentor/how-do-i-set-up-a-sales-commission-structure/): it works a little bit like how *fin-tech* companies do it. In exchange for $33 a month, _[Hey You PTY LTD](http://abr.business.gov.au/SearchByAbn.aspx?abn=34144912158)_ provides cafés with a queueing system and integrates them into their network of registered cafés. Then for every purchase done through the app, *Hey You* [takes a small percentage](http://www.startupdaily.net/2013/10/why-wait-in-line-when-you-can-beat-the-q/), and cafés pay for all the credit card transaction fees.

All in all, it’s a really clever way of managing cost and revenue. But what really piqued my interest, was their technical implementation. (If you’ll allow me to geek out a bit here...)

The entire system runs on [Amazon’s scalable cloud infrastructure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ5H8sn_2ZI). This means that they can easily handle a huge spike in user signups (from tens to the thousands) and have the monthly fee of a single café cover the cost. 

This cloud infrastructure is usually reserved for big data tech companies like Facebook or [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com). But *Hey You*’s engineering team [was clever enough to use it early](https://engineering.heyyou.io/continuous-everything-1c23bb0f6d1a), which means very little money is burned at managing servers and software.

That means *Hey You* maximises revenue not just externally through their commission model, but also internally thanks to their [engineering team](https://engineering.heyyou.io). This is what a lot of fledging startups need to take advantage of— especially if they’re trying to enter the tech space.

Engineering aside, I see an opportunity for *Hey You* to scale into fast-food outlets and other chains. There are still queues in every *Grill’d* or *San Churro* I walk into, waiting to be replaced by a pre-ordering system. *Hey You* would have to move fast however— and as [competitors](http://skip.com.au) crop up alongside them— it won’t be long until big food franchises develop their own.

Since 2011, *Hey You* has reached over 500,000 users, partnered with over [56,000 cafés](http://www.smartcompany.com.au/business-advice/strategy/44361-posse-and-beat-the-q-merge-to-create-new-business/) around Australia (and New Zealand) and has processed an average of over 400,000 transactions *per month*. And after [Westpac’s investment and partnership](https://info.westpac.com.au/heyyou/), they’re now a [Series A startup](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/beat-the-q#/entity) valued at just over $5 million dollars.

The secret to *Hey You*’s success isn’t just because their idea is so original. It’s because they took advantage of an existing industry and made it even better. And for us coffee-loving *Melbournites*— we’ll never have to wait in line for our coffee, ever again.
